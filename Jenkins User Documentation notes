Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

The Jenkins credentials functionality is provided by the Credentials Binding plugin.

Jenkins can store the following types of credentials:

   Secret text - a token such as an API token (e.g. a GitHub personal access token),

   Username and password - which could be handled as separate components or as a colon separated string in the format username:password (read more about this in Handling credentials),

   Secret file - which is essentially secret content in a file,

   SSH Username with private key - an SSH public/private key pair,

   Certificate - a PKCS#12 certificate file and optional password, or

   Docker Host Certificate Authentication credentials.
   
 Credentials can be added to Jenkins by any Jenkins user who has the Credentials > Create permission (set through Matrix-based security). 
 
 Otherwise, any Jenkins user can add and configure credentials if the Authorization settings of your Jenkins instance’s Configure Global Security settings page is set to the default Logged-in users can do anything setting or Anyone can do anything setting.

 Pipeline jobs can by stopped by sending an HTTP POST request to URL endpoints of a build.

    BUILD ID URL/stop - aborts a Pipeline.

    BUILD ID URL/term - forcibly terminates a build (should only be used if stop does not work).

    BUILD ID URL/kill - hard kill a pipeline. This is the most destructive way to stop a pipeline and should only be used as a last resort.
    
 Jenkins supports file fingerprinting to track dependencies.
 
 Go to your project, click Configure in the left navigation bar, then scroll down to the Post-build Actions section of the job

    Click on the button to add a Post-build action.

    Select Record fingerprints of files to track usage.
    
 Maven job type does this automatically for its dependencies and artifacts.
 
 Fingerprint location: $JENKINS_HOME/fingerprints
 
 Plugins can store additional information with regards to fingerprints. For example, Deployment Notification Plugin tracks files deployed on servers via chef/puppet through fingerprints.

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.

pipeline plugin is a suggested plugin

A Pipeline can be created in one of the following ways:

  Through Blue Ocean - after setting up a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, the Blue Ocean UI helps you write your Pipeline’s Jenkinsfile and commit it to source control.

  Through the classic UI - you can enter a basic Pipeline directly in Jenkins through the classic UI.

  In SCM - you can write a Jenkinsfile manually, which you can commit to your project’s source control repository.
  
Creating a Jenkinsfile and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:

  Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.

  Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).

  Audit trail for the Pipeline.

  Single source of truth [3] for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project.  
   
  The Multibranch Pipeline project type enables you to implement different Jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project.
  
  By default, Jenkins will not automatically re-index the repository for branch additions or deletions (unless using an Organization Folder)
  
  Organization Folders enable Jenkins to monitor an entire GitHub Organization, Bitbucket Team/Project, GitLab organization, or Gitea organization and automatically create new Multibranch Pipelines for repositories which contain branches and pull requests containing a Jenkinsfile.
 
 Pipeline is also extensible both by users with Pipeline Shared Libraries and by plugin developers.
