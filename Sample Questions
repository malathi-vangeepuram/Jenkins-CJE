1. By definition, what does a Continuous Delivery pipeline consist of?
a. Backlog items
b. Artifacts
c. Stages
d. Tickets
e. Commitments

2. You need to execute a shell script (/usr/bin/prepare-env) just before a Linux agent is started. How do you achieve this?
a. Use the "Suffix Start Agent Command" configuration option on the agent configuration.
b. Use the "Prefix Start Agent Command" configuration option on the agent configuration.
c. Configure a .profile file containing a call to /usr/bin/prepare-env in the home directory of the OS user which runs the agent
process.
d. Add a shell step to each Job tied to this agent to execute the shell script.

3. Suppose you are asked to obtain the config.xml of a folder (myFolder) from a script or HTTP client using the Jenkins Remote
API. The folder exists at the root of a Jenkins master. Which URL pattern is correct for obtaining this configuration file?
a. root/job/myFolder/config.xml
b. root/folder/myFolder/config.xml
c. root/myFolder/config.xml
d. root/myFolder?param=config.xml
e. root/api/getConfig?source=myFolder

4. What architecture is recommended by the Jenkins Cookbook for a scalable Jenkins environment?
a. Distributed Builds Architecture
b. Central Master Architecture
c. Automatic Builds Architecture D. Manual Polling Architecture E. One-Shot Build Architecture

5. In a Cluster Operations Job, which THREE of the following steps can be applied to a Client Master only?
a. Install Jenkins
b. Upgrade Jenkins
c. Upgrade all plugins D. Install plugin
d. Uninstall Jenkins

6. A lot of things in jenkins can be automated or customized using groovy scripts. If a jenkins operator writes a jenkins 
   script, is it guaranteed that it will always run in the jenikins environment or does it need further approval ?
a. Yes, any groovy script written will always run in jenkins environment, provided user has build permissions on a pipeline.   
b. Script will be allowed to run, provided developer is using scriped pipeline methodology.
c. All groovy scripts will by default run in groovy sandbox, provided they are trusted or safe. Any untrusted script needs to 
   be approved explicitly by administrators using in-process script approval. 
d. Yes, it will be allowed only for authenticated users. Anonymous users cannot run groovy scripts. 
e. All groovy scripts need to be approved, no matter how simple/safe they are deemed to be. Without approval, nothing would be allowed. 

7. The new CTO of your company boosts that in his earlier company they used to follow the practice of maintaining code in such a way that 
   it could be put into production any time. This would enable them to deploy code as soon as somebody requests it. In devops, what is it 
   referred to as ? 
   a. Continuous Integration
   b. This is not possible at all
   c. Continuous deployment 
   d. Continuous delivery
   e. This is basic essence of devops and happens by default in every organization. There is no label to it as such.
   
 8. You want to ensure that you are able to quickly distinguish between builds that are of high quality and builds that are not at par.
    This would enable you to push the builds into the next stage in your process (For ex Dev- > QA -> prod). What should you do? 
    a. Manually track all builds. Keep a tracker to identify high quality builds. 
    b. Enable email notificaion for failed builds. If a build fails, developer will know that the build is not of high quality 
    c. Use build promotion plugin. Put in a place a criteria / process to identify good builds and subsequently promote them. 
    d. This default feature of jenkins. You do not need to do anything extra to enable this. 
    
  9. Your company started with jenkins for a single, small project and now wants to use for 100s of medium to big size projects. 
     As of now you only have 1 server running jenkins. What can you do achieve this high scale. 
     a. Add  more jenkins masters to the set up. Enable load balancing. Each master will consume a portion of the input load. 
     b. Enable jenkins system configuration 'HA'. As soon as you do this, jenkins will automatically scale up/down as per the requirement.
     c. There is no way to do this in jenkins. Only option is to scale up jenkins VM meaning add more CPU/RAM to it. 
     d. Add as many agent/slave nodes as needed. Make sure there are no builds running in jenkins master. Scale up jenkins master if needed,
        but first scale out jenkins slaves. 
     e. Create separate jenkins cluster and use cloudbees jenkins operation center to manage them.
