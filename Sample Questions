1. By definition, what does a Continuous Delivery pipeline consist of?
a. Backlog items
b. Artifacts
c. Stages
d. Tickets
e. Commitments

2. You need to execute a shell script (/usr/bin/prepare-env) just before a Linux agent is started. How do you achieve this?
a. Use the "Suffix Start Agent Command" configuration option on the agent configuration.
b. Use the "Prefix Start Agent Command" configuration option on the agent configuration.
c. Configure a .profile file containing a call to /usr/bin/prepare-env in the home directory of the OS user which runs the agent
process.
d. Add a shell step to each Job tied to this agent to execute the shell script.

3. Suppose you are asked to obtain the config.xml of a folder (myFolder) from a script or HTTP client using the Jenkins Remote
API. The folder exists at the root of a Jenkins master. Which URL pattern is correct for obtaining this configuration file?
a. root/job/myFolder/config.xml
b. root/folder/myFolder/config.xml
c. root/myFolder/config.xml
d. root/myFolder?param=config.xml
e. root/api/getConfig?source=myFolder

4. What architecture is recommended by the Jenkins Cookbook for a scalable Jenkins environment?
a. Distributed Builds Architecture
b. Central Master Architecture
c. Automatic Builds Architecture D. Manual Polling Architecture E. One-Shot Build Architecture

5. In a Cluster Operations Job, which THREE of the following steps can be applied to a Client Master only?
a. Install Jenkins
b. Upgrade Jenkins
c. Upgrade all plugins D. Install plugin
d. Uninstall Jenkins

6. A lot of things in jenkins can be automated or customized using groovy scripts. If a jenkins operator writes a jenkins 
   script, is it guaranteed that it will always run in the jenikins environment or does it need further approval ?
a. Yes, any groovy script written will always run in jenkins environment, provided user has build permissions on a pipeline.   
b. Script will be allowed to run, provided developer is using scriped pipeline methodology.
c. All groovy scripts will by default run in groovy sandbox, provided they are trusted or safe. Any untrusted script needs to 
   be approved explicitly by administrators using in-process script approval. 
d. Yes, it will be allowed only for authenticated users. Anonymous users cannot run groovy scripts. 
e. All groovy scripts need to be approved, no matter how simple/safe they are deemed to be. Without approval, nothing would be allowed. 

7. The new CTO of your company boosts that in his earlier company they used to follow the practice of maintaining code in such a way that 
   it could be put into production any time. This would enable them to deploy code as soon as somebody requests it. In devops, what is it 
   referred to as ? 
   a. Continuous Integration
   b. This is not possible at all
   c. Continuous deployment 
   d. Continuous delivery
   e. This is basic essence of devops and happens by default in every organization. There is no label to it as such.
   
 8. You want to ensure that you are able to quickly distinguish between builds that are of high quality and builds that are not at par.
    This would enable you to push the builds into the next stage in your process (For ex Dev- > QA -> prod). What should you do? 
    a. Manually track all builds. Keep a tracker to identify high quality builds. 
    b. Enable email notificaion for failed builds. If a build fails, developer will know that the build is not of high quality 
    c. Use build promotion plugin. Put in a place a criteria / process to identify good builds and subsequently promote them. 
    d. This default feature of jenkins. You do not need to do anything extra to enable this. 
    
  9. Your company started with jenkins for a single, small project and now wants to use for 100s of medium to big size projects. 
     As of now you only have 1 server running jenkins. What can you do achieve this high scale. 
     a. Add  more jenkins masters to the set up. Enable load balancing. Each master will consume a portion of the input load. 
     b. Enable jenkins system configuration 'HA'. As soon as you do this, jenkins will automatically scale up/down as per the requirement.
     c. There is no way to do this in jenkins. Only option is to scale up jenkins VM meaning add more CPU/RAM to it. 
     d. Add as many agent/slave nodes as needed. Make sure there are no builds running in jenkins master. Scale up jenkins master if needed,
        but first scale out jenkins slaves. 
     e. Create separate jenkins cluster and use cloudbees jenkins operation center to manage them.   
     
  10. Your CTO has instructed you to find a easy and simple solution to back up all jenkins instances in your environment. It needs to be cost effective.
      but the main focus is to easily implement it. 
      
      a. Simply back up JENKINS_HOME directory. It has enough info to restore jenkins to a new compute instance. 
      b. There is no simple way as such. Only way is to take the disk / data snapshot of the VM. 
      c. Simply copy/backup config.xml file, rest is redundant and is downloaded from jenkins cloud master set up, at boot up. 
      d. Enable jenkins replication. This feature of jenkins using which youncan very easily replicate the data and config from one 
         jenkins master to another. 
         
  11. Why should you not run builds in jenkins master 
      a. Running buiklds in jenkins master is costlier than running in slave nodes, as master should always use SSD disks, while slaves us HDD disks.
      b. Due to how jenkins is architectured, you must have atleast 1 executor in the master node. Otherwise, your application  will not in jenkins slave also. 
      c. This is a complete incorrect statement. Master slave mode in jenkins was created to ensure that builds run on master node and slave stores the artifacts.
      d. Running jobs in master can be security concern, as your jobs have access to JENKINS_HOME directory, effectively enabling them to delete/modify/create update 
         jenkins which is not a good situation to be in. 
         
  12. You have a distributed build team, with developers across the spectrum working on variety of topics. This sometimes resulting in confusion as to what artifact output
      from one build pipeline is being used / leveraged in the subsequent build/test/release pipeline. What can be used to ensure that you can keep a track of what version 
      of a file / artifact  is being used in a build / pipeline job? 
      a. Build promotion can be used to track artifact usage across builds. 
      b. You need to store artifacts in github and version control them to understand their usage patterns and come up with conclusions. 
      c. This is not possible in jenkins, you need to write custom groovy extesnions for that. 
      d. You need to fingerprint the artifacts. Then you can very easliy understand what version of artifact is being leveraged in what build number and so
         effectively allowing dependency tracking in your system .
         
  13. In a distributed build architecture for jenkins, what is the best practice regarding Agent / slave jenkins nodes ? 
  
      a. There is a hard upper limit of 5 agent nodes per jenkins master node. 
      b. You should treat jenkins slave nodes as a fungible / replaceable in the sense that they should not store important configuration information that 
         cannot be recreated within the build process. 
      c. You should not mix agents of different OS types like windows / linux. It is better to use only one type of agents to keep control of your system. 
      d. Always use cloud agents. Do not us on-prem agents as they are not that secure / cost effective. 
      
   14. If you have a parameterised job which takes 2-3 string parameters as input, how can i leverage those parameters within my job/pipeline code meaning 
       how do i reference them ? 
       a. Every string parameter is exposed as an environment variable of the same name, which you can use effectively to reference them. 
       b. You need to install jenkins string variable plugin to be able to use string parameters, other wise it won't work. 
       c. All variables you declare can be referenced using a hashmap of values, with key name set to variable name. 
       d. Actually, string parameters are not supported directly, you need to encode them into files  and then pass them as file parameters. 
       
   15. I have a jenkins pipeline that needs a code snippet to run in both windows and linux environment for the build to succeed. How can i accomodate such 
       a thing in jenkins 
       a. You need to have 2 separate jenkins master installations, one for windows and one for linux. then you need to split the pipeline to run different 
          steps in different masters. 
       b. You can have single master but different slave nodes one for windows and one for linux but still need to split the pipeline into 2 separate pipelines,
          make one run for windows and other for linux. 
       c. You can have a single jenkins master but different slave nodes one for windows and one for linux . You dont need to split the pipeline into 2 separate 
          pipelines , you can simply specify which stage runs on which agent and so on.
       d. The above is not possible in jenkins. You need to install OSConcurrency plugin to allow different agent VM's to support different OS variants. 
       
   16. You have a jenkins distributed build environment set up where the agent VM's are in on-prem (behind the firewall) , while the master is in cloud meaning master 
       cannot initiate connection to the agents. How to set up master agent communication in such use cases? 
       
       a. There is no option as such, for distributed builds the master must be able to initiate communication to agents, there is no other way. 
       b. You can initiate agent to master communcation via JNLP. It is not always mandatory for master to initiate communication. 
       c. The only way is to set up jenkins HA cluster with all VM's acting like both master and slave. 
       d. You have enable all flow initally, then once the master communicates to the agent for the first time, then afterwards you can close up the F/W again 
          and the flow will still work , once the initial set up is done. 
          
   17. Your security team has verified  your jenkins set up and are adamant that you need to set up audit logging to ensure that you can track what user is doing 
        what. what should be your response to the security team. 
        
        a. Ensure them that is available by default, of the box in jenkins. Share them the audit log 
        b. Mention that this is not possible in jenkins.  Only way is to control security via matrix based security but cannot pin point who did what. 
        c. Ensure them that auditing per user action is not needed as JENKINS_HOME has been completely locked down and only administrators can access it. 
        d. Install jenkins audit trail plugin. set up a logger sink to output all audit logs to either a file /console/syslog...and finally share the audit logs 
           to audit team for future audits.
